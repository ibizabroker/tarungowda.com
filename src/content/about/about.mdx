Hey there I'm Tarun, nice to meet you! I'm a software developer who thrives on exploring and working with new technology. Building tools and applications that solve everyday
problems is my jam, and the journey from ideation to implementation is always an exciting one for me.

## A Journey of Solutions

You know how it goes - you encounter a problem, and instead of waiting for someone else to solve it, you roll up your sleeves and dive in. That's been my approach to development,
and it's led me down some pretty interesting paths. Here are some of the instances where I ideated through a problem and tried to fix it:

#### Ever Wanted a Simple Yet Stylish Clock for Your Fitbit?

You know, when I got my first smartwatch, the Fitbit Versa 3, I wanted a clockface that was simple yet visually appealing. So, I rolled up my sleeves and created the
[Minimalistic Digital](/projects/minimalistic-digital) clockface. Surprisingly, it has gained over 50k downloads with a rating of 4.8/5 on the Fitbit store! It was a lightbulb
moment for me, realizing that what started as my personal inconvenience could resonate with so many others.

#### Tired of Being the Expense Manager for Your Squad?

Ever used Splitwise and ended up being the only one managing expenses for the whole group? Been there, done that. That's why I developed [EZ Split](/projects/ez-split),
an expense-splitting app that's hassle-free and doesn't come with pesky paywalls or the annoyance of constantly expiring login tokens. It's live on the Play Store,
simplifying expense management for me and hopefully for you too!

#### Say Hello to the Future of HR Assistance

When I got into generative AI, I found myself constantly brainstorming innovative solutions. One day, it hit me: what if there was an AI bot that could streamline HR processes?
As I pondered further, I realized that organizations predominantly use platforms like Slack and Teams for communication. That's when inspiration struck for
[HR Virtuoso](/projects/slack-hr-gpt) - a bot integrated into Slack, powered by generative AI and fueled by company policies. This bot would serve as a virtual HR assistant,
accessible to all employees, answering queries that you might have related to the company. No more endless back-and-forth with HR; just a seamless, efficient experience for
everyone involved.

#### Automating Mundane Tasks with Discord Magic

Back in my undergrad days as the placement coordinator, one of the many tasks used to be verifying students' CGPA against company cutoffs was a time-consuming task involving
endless Excel comparisons. That's when I decided to automate the process with a [Discord bot](/projects/spcbot). Now, with just a few clicks, I could input
the Google Forms-generated Excel file and let the bot handle the rest. This was a gamechanger for me, it helped me save countless hours.

## Music

My taste in music has been pretty consistent over the past few years. I've really found genres like rock, metal, metalcore, prog rock, alt rock and prog metal to be my go to. There's just something about the combination of riffs, melodies and the energy of these genres that gets me pumped up for the challenges to come.

I've been diving deep into some killer tracks and artists lately. Here are my top 5 tracks and artists that I've had on repeat in the past 4 weeks:

I do have my moments when I crave some mellow vibes. I've actually put together this chill playlist that's perfect for those times when I need to unwind or just zone out 
for a bit.
