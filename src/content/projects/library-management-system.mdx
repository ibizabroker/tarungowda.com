## Overview
The Library Management System is a comprehensive portal designed to efficiently track and manage the books available in a library. It serves two primary user roles: administrators and regular users.

***Administrator Features:***

- `Add Books`: Administrators have the privilege to add new books to the system, including details such as title, author, genre, and available copies.
- `View Books`: Administrators can view a complete list of all books present in the library, along with their respective details.
- `Borrow History`: Administrators have access to the borrowing history of each book, facilitating efficient management of book circulation.
- `Delete Books`: If necessary, administrators can remove books from the system, ensuring an up-to-date and accurate catalog.
- `User Management`: Administrators can register new users into the system and maintain a list of current users.

***User Features:***

- `Borrow Books`: Users can browse the catalog, check the availability of books, and borrow them as needed.
- `Return Books`: Upon finishing with a borrowed book, users can return it through the system, making it available for others.
- `Check Availability`: Users can ascertain the number of copies available for a particular book, aiding informed borrowing decisions.

The Library Management System streamlines library operations, offering administrators robust tools for catalog management and user administration, while providing users with a user-friendly interface to explore and borrow books efficiently.
