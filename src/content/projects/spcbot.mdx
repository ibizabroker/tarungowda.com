## Overview
SPC Bot, originally developed during my tenure as a student placement coordinator in my undergrad, serves as a versatile Discord bot designed to automate various manual tasks. Primarily, it streamlines the verification process of Excel files, a task integral to my role. The bot efficiently cross-references incoming Excel files with an online Google Sheet containing student information, ensuring accuracy and expediting the verification process.

***Key Features:***
- `Excel File Verification`: SPC Bot automates the verification of Excel files by comparing them with the information stored in an online Google Sheet, reducing manual effort and enhancing accuracy.
- `Eligibility Criteria Assessment`: Leveraging student data stored in the Google Sheet, the bot identifies eligible students for participation in placement drives based on predetermined criteria such as CGPA.
- `Custom Commands`: SPC Bot offers additional functionality through custom commands tailored to specific needs, providing flexibility and versatility in its usage.
- `Integration with Discord`: Seamlessly integrated within Discord, the bot facilitates easy access for the placement coordinators to automate some of their work.

SPC Bot represents a testament to the power of automation in optimizing workflow efficiency and reducing manual overhead. From Excel file verification to eligibility assessment, this bot streamlines critical processes, enabling student placement coordinators to focus on strategic initiatives and deliver enhanced support to students.
